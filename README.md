# Reference Security Incident Taxonomy Working Group
This GitHub repository hosts files relating to the ENISA Reference Security Incident Taxonomy Working Group.

## Background
During the ‘51st TF-CSIRT meeting’ (held on 15 May 2017 in The Hague, Netherlands) the CSIRT community concluded that there was an urgent need for an incident taxonomy (i.e., classification scheme) that serves as a fixed reference for all CSIRTs.

ENISA and TF-CSIRT therefore created the ‘Reference Security Incident Taxonomy Working Group' (RSIT WG) with the aim of enabling the CSIRT community to reach a consensus on a security incident reference taxonomy. The RSIT WG was approved as official TF-CSIRT working group by the TF-CSIRT Steering Committee on 26 September 2018.

During the 2nd meeting at 53rd TF-CSIRT in Hamburg it was decided to use eCSIRT.net as starting point for the RSIT, and use this as it is for version 1.
